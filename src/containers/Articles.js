/*
Here, we first import connect(), a function that returns a higher-order function
and receive as input a component. It helps us to connect our component
to the store and give access to get the state.

Then, we declare a new function named mapStateToProps()
(you can name it whatever you like).
It's used to get our state from the redux store.
The function receives as parameter the state stored in redux
and returns a JavaScript object that will hold our articles.

And to reach the store, we need to pass mapStateToProps()
to the connect function. It will take our component Articles
and return a wrapper component with the props it injects.
That means we can now get our state from the store.
The state is received by the component through
props, we can still show the articles as before but now through redux.

We've successfully connected our store to react and get
our state from it. Now, let's dive into actions
